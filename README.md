# pdf-recursive-compressing
CLI tool to recursively compress PDF files in Unix systems.

## Known problems
> This script is just meant to work by now, so problems with secondary features tend to happen or not be implemented at all

- [ ] Initial and final total sizes are not being measured the right way
- [ ] Helpful --help and CLI arguments are pending to be done
- [ ] ps2pdf probably not being used in an eficient way
